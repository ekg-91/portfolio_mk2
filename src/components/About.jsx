        <p>Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.
          Shut up and get to the point! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew,
          Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film.
          But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on
          motorcycles. Roll film!</p>
